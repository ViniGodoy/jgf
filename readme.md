Java Game Framework
===================

This is a simple yet functional framework for games using pure J2SE. I made it for educational purposes while studying Developing Games in Java and Killer Game Programming in Java books. I also included some ideas, and used Java 5 resources (both these books are written in Java 4 era).

The framework include classes for:
* Reading, stripping and transforming images;
* A xml resource loader
* Network classes for UDP
* A particle generator;
* Classes for A* pathfinding, both in Graphs and in tile maps;
* Some math classes;
* Game loop control.

This project is not intended to be a professional framework or to be a replacement for the excellent Slick2D (a much better alternative for games in Java).
